# CrowSoft

The customer would like an on-line system to take in building details for analysis. CrowSoft is a
engineering and tech company. The product that they wish to market is BusIntelligence. The system
must take details for buildings and to provide easy to use analysis features. For example, they may
wish to have a review all buildings which cost more than â‚¬1 million to build and have special features
as this may indicate future maintenance projects that may be exploited. Keep the analysis simple. The
analysis system should be clean and simple. The system needs to take into account the usual details
and present simplified graphics. It must be possible to upload files or images. The administrator should
be able to access detailed information and edit as appropriate. Once the client enters details it should
not be able to be changed by the client.
